# MolSimX-V1.0
A multifunction toolbox for molecular electronics developed in Prof. Xi. Yu's lab at Tianjin University School of Science, using the MATLAB platform. The toolbox is available on the MolSimX GitHub page at [https://github.com/fructose04/MolSimX-V1.0](https://github.com/yuxi-TJU/MolSimX), which includes a code folder and an app folder. The code folder contains the source code for the toolbox, allowing users to customize and modify the functionality to suit their needs. The app folder provides a standalone MATLAB application that enables users to easily access and use the toolbox's functions without the need for programming knowledge. MolSimX is designed to facilitate the design, simulation, and analysis of molecular electronic devices and to support researchers and engineers in the field.

We would like to acknowledge the following contributors to the development of MolSimX: Zheyang Li, Xuan Ji, Xianneng Song, and Esther Martine Opodi.
